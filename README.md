About project:

This project is a multi-functional AI toolkit that integrates LLMs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), fine-tuning, multimodal AI, and agent-based reasoning. It includes a RAG pipeline with FAISS for retrieving relevant documents, LoRA-based fine-tuning for customizing LLMs, and optimized inference using vLLM for faster responses. Additionally, it supports CLIP-based multimodal search (text + images) and an LLM-powered agent with LangChain for autonomous reasoning. This project can be used to build intelligent AI chatbots, search engines, and research assistants with efficient and context-aware responses.
